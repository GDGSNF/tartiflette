**Tartiflette** is a GraphQL Server implementation built with **Python 3.5+**.

**Tartiflette is under heavy development. [Feel free to join us to build Tartiflette](./docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).**

**DNA**

* Define the **GraphQL schema** with the brand new [SDL _(Schema Definition Language)_](https://github.com/facebook/graphql/blob/master/spec/Section%203%20--%20Type%20System.md).
* **Performance oriented:** Performance is the core of our work.
* **Simple is better than complex:** Built with [the Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/#id3) in mind. No over-engineering.
