## Plugins approach

The idea behind the plugin approach of tartiflette is to bring extensibility, community and reusability to your sdl using [Directive](/docs/api/directive.md), [Custom Scalar](/docs/api/scalar.md) and [Resolver](/docs/api/resolver.md) as plugins.

## What is a tartiflette plugin ?

A tartiflette plugin is a python package that will prodive a bit of SDL defining Directives, Scalar, Types, etc and code implementation of those objects.

It's name should be prefixed by `tartiflette-plugins-`, I.E. for a plugin named `oauth`, its pypi package will be `tartiflette-plugin-oauth` and its python package will be `tartiflette_plugin_oauth`.

##Â How can I create one ?
