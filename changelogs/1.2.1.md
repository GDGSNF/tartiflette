# [1.2.1] - 2020-05-06

## Fixed

- [ISSUE-381](https://github.com/dailymotion/tartiflette/issues/381) - Now `pre_output_coercion` hooks are called when `OBJECT` types are retrieved through an `UNION` or an `INTERFACE`. Furthermore `UNION/INTERFACE` hooks are also called before the `Object` ones are called.

## Changed

- `pytest` is now in version 2.5.2
