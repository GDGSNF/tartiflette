# [1.4.0] 2021-08-02

## Added

- [PR-461](https://github.com/tartiflette/tartiflette/pull/461) - Add a `coerce_parent_concurrently` parameter to `create_engine`, `Engine.__init__` & `Engine.cook` to control whether or not field will be coerced concurrently
- [PR-461](https://github.com/tartiflette/tartiflette/pull/461) - Add a `parent_concurrently` parameter to both `@Resolver` & `@Subscription` in order to control whether or not the decorated field should be coerced concurrently
- [PR-514](https://github.com/tartiflette/tartiflette/pull/514) - Provides wheels for macOS (`x86_64` only) and Linux (`x86_64` only). If your system architecture is one of those, you may not need to install `cmake` anymore, as the wheels come pre-built with a compiled version of `libgraphqlparser`
